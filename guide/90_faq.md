#### What is the relationship between Gren and Elm?

Gren started as a fork of Elm. This is mostly considered to be an implementation detail, a way to speed up initial development.

It's not a goal of Gren to become a replacement, or stay compatible in any way, with Elm.

#### Why is the language called Gren?

Gren is a norwegian word, meaning branch. This pays homage to both of Gren's origins: Norway and Elm.

#### Why is Gren's logo a bird?

The bird is a robin, which happens to be the name of Gren's founder. The robin is placed within the G, which is meant to symbolize that it is sitting on G(ren), which is the norwegian word for branch.
