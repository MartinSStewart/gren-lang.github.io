Today marks the first release of Gren, a programming language that helps you write simple and correct software.

Gren is a pure functional language, with a strict type checker. It began as a fork of [Elm](https://elm-lang.org), so it currently has great support for writing applications that run in the browser. In the future, Gren aims to support writing CLI tools and backend applications as well.

Version 0.1.0 is considered to be an alpha release. While you can write production quality software with it today, there are likely bugs in the compiler and core packages, and breaking changes are planned for the next release.

To learn more about the language, head over to the [guide](/learn). If you'd like to try it out, then you'll find instructions on getting started [here](/install).

If you like what you see, consider joining the [community](/community). We can use all the help we can get.

### Looking forward

Gren follows a six-month release cadence. The plan for 0.2.0 is to add support for more Web API's and basic support for applications running on the Node.js runtime. In addition, the package manager will see become more efficient and reliable.

### Thank you, contributors
